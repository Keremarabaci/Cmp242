# Hello Kerem, thank you for the invitation. I go through the existing files. You've tried, but you need to put more effort. Meanwhile, where is your project IDEA file? 
# NOTE: THE PROJECT IDEA SHOULD REFLECT ALL THE TOPICS WE'VE COVERED ON THE POOP CONCEPT IN OUR CLASS. I WILL APPRECIATE YOU WHEN YOU PUT EXTRA EFFORT. 
I AM WILLING TO JOIN YOU IN THE PROJECT 

Also, clearly explain each block of code in your existing files.

Thank you.
